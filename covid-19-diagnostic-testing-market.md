<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nucleic Acid Testing</li><li>Antibody Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The COVID-19 diagnostic testing market encompasses two primary types: nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing. Nucleic acid testing, including PCR tests, detects the virus's genetic material, indicating active infection. This method is highly sensitive and specific, providing timely results for diagnosing current cases. Antibody testing, on the other hand, identifies antibodies in individualsâ€™ blood, indicating past exposure to the virus. While useful for understanding population immunity, it does not confirm active infection. Both methods play crucial roles in managing the pandemic.</p></p>
