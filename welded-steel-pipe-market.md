<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welded Steel Pipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Drawing Processing Technique</li><li>Hot Rolling Processing Technique</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The welded steel pipe market can be categorized into two primary processing techniques: cold drawing and hot rolling. Cold drawing involves pulling heated steel through a die, enhancing its strength and dimensional precision. This method results in smoother finishes and tighter tolerances, making it suitable for high-pressure applications. In contrast, hot rolling involves shaping steel by deforming it at high temperatures, which allows for easier shaping and larger diameter pipes. Each technique serves specific industry needs based on strength, diameter, and production efficiency.</p></p>
