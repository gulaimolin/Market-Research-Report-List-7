<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immune Checkpoint Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-PD-L1 Drug</li><li>Anti-PD-1 Drug</li><li>CTLA4</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The immune checkpoint agents market consists of three primary types: anti-PD-L1 drugs, anti-PD-1 drugs, and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Anti-PD-L1 drugs block the ligand that inhibits T-cell activation, enhancing immune response against tumors. Anti-PD-1 drugs target the programmed cell death protein 1 receptor on T-cells, promoting immune activity. CTLA-4 inhibitors disrupt regulatory pathways that limit T-cell activation, thereby boosting immune responses. Together, these agents play a crucial role in cancer immunotherapy, offering innovative treatment options for patients.</p></p>
