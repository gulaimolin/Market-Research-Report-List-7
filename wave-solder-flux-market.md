<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wave Solder Flux Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Corrosive</li><li>Non-Corrosive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wave solder flux market is categorized into corrosive and non-corrosive types based on their chemical properties and post-soldering effects. Corrosive fluxes contain active acids or halides that enhance solderability but leave residues requiring thorough cleaning to prevent long-term damage to components. Non-corrosive fluxes, often rosin-based or no-clean, are less aggressive, leaving minimal or no residues, making them suitable for sensitive electronics where cleaning is impractical. Both types cater to different manufacturing needs, balancing performance and reliability.</p></p>
