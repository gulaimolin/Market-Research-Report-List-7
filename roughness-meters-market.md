<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Roughness Meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non-Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The roughness meters market is primarily divided into two types: contact and non-contact instruments. Contact roughness meters utilize a stylus or probe that physically touches the surface being measured, providing detailed and accurate profiling of surface texture. Non-contact roughness meters, on the other hand, employ laser or optical methods to assess surface characteristics without direct interaction, reducing the risk of damage and allowing for measurements on delicate or sensitive materials. Both types cater to diverse industrial applications.</p></p>
